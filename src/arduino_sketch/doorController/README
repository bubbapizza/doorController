This is an arduino sketch that acts as a simple door controller.
It reads RFID cards from a Parallax serial RFID card reader.  It also
controls two LEDs and a piezo buzzer.  

The controller has no logic in it whatsoever.  All it does is accept 
single character commands over the serial port which can be used
to control the lights, buzzers and rfid controller.  All logic should
be handled by external software.

I've also included a couple Arduino sketches for dealing w/ Wiegand RFID 
card readers.  I'm not sure if the wiegand stuff actually works or not
since I never tested it.  One sketch is an RFID emulator which is 
supposed to emulate a wiegand card reader.  The other sketch is for 
controlling a door using a device that speaks the wiegand protocol.
