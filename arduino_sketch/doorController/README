This is an arduino sketch that acts as a simple door controller.
It reads RFID cards from a Parallax serial RFID card reader.  It also
controls two LEDs, a piezo buzzer and a relay to open the door.  

The controller has no logic in it whatsoever.  All it does is accept 
single character commands over the serial port which can be used
to control the lights, buzzers and rfid controller.  All logic should
be handled by external software.
