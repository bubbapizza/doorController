This is (going to be) a full DIY solution for a door controller.
The door can be locked or unlocked using an arduino or a raspberry pi
to interface witha Parallax serial RFID card reader for the controller
hardware.

The backend logic for the door controller is handled in python.  
The arduino sketches have no logic in them whatsoever.  All they do is 
accept single character commands over the virtual serial port 
and control some lights, a buzzer and rfid controller.  All back-end logic
is handled using python.

I've also included a couple Arduino sketches for dealing w/ Wiegand RFID 
card readers.  I'm not sure if the wiegand stuff actually works or not
since I never tested it.  One sketch is an RFID emulator which is 
supposed to emulate a wiegand card reader.  The other sketch is for 
controlling a door using a device that speaks the wiegand protocol.
