This is an arduino sketch that acts as a simple door controller.
It's supposed to read from an RFID reader and send out the code over
serial.  Also it takes single character commands to lock and unlock
a door.

I've also included an RFID emulator sketch which is supposed to 
emulate an RFID reader.

NOTE: I'm not sure if this code works or not because I had two arduinos
to test with and I couldn't get them to communicate via the Wiegand 
protocol.  I'm not sure if I wired them together wrong or if there's 
something wrong w/ the code.
